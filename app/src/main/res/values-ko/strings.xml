\n
\n\t• 귀하는 고유 재량에 따라 Crash Reporter와 같은 Wolvic의 특정 기능을 통해 Igalia에 피드백을 제출할 수 있습니다. 귀하가 피드백을 제출하는 경우, 해당 피드백을 사용하여 제품을 개선하고 Wolvic의 웹사이트에 익명화된 피드백을 게시, 배포할 수 있는 권한이 Igalia에 부여됩니다.
\n
\n\t• Wolvic을 통해 Igalia에 제출된 귀하의 개인 정보 및 피드백을 어떻게 사용하는지는 Wolvic 개인정보 보호정책에 설명되어 있습니다.
\n
\n\t• 일부 Wolvic 기능은 웹 기반 정보 서비스를 사용합니다. 하지만 우리는 이 서비스들이 정확하거나 오류가 없다고 보증하지 않습니다. 자세한 내용(웹 기반 정보 서비스를 사용하는 기능을 비활성화하는 방법 포함)은 아래 서비스 약관에서 확인할 수 있습니다.</string>

    <string name="terms_service_section_2">Wolvic의 제공하는 일부 기능들은 웹 기반 정보 서비스(이하 \"서비스\")를 아래 설명된 조건에 따라 바이너리 형태의 Wolvic과 함께 사용합니다.
\n
\n\t• Igalia와 컨트리뷰터, 라이센서 및 파트너는 가장 정확하고 최신의 서비스를 제공하기 위해 노력하고 있습니다. 하지만 우리는 이 정보가 완전하며 오류가 없다고 보장할 수 없습니다. 예를 들어, 세이프 브라우징 서비스는 일부 위험한 사이트를 식별하지 못할 수 있으며 일부 안전한 사이트를 잘못 식별할 수 있습니다. 또 다른 예로, 위치 인식 서비스의 경우 서비스 제공 업체에서 반환하는 모든 위치는 추정치일 뿐이며, 우리 혹은 서비스 제공 업체 모두 제공된 위치의 정확성을 보장하지 않습니다.
\n
\n\t• Igalia는 고유 재량에 따라 서비스를 중단하거나 변경할 수 있습니다.
\n
\n\t• 귀하는 서비스를 Wolvic과 함께 언제든지 사용할 수 있으며, Igalia는 귀하에게 서비스를 사용할 수 있는 권리를 부여합니다. 서비스에 대한 다른 모든 권리는 Igalia와 그 라이센서가 보유합니다. 이 약관은 Wolvic 및 Wolvic의 소스코드에 적용되는 오픈 소스 라이선스에 의해 부여된 권한을 제한하는 것으로 해석되지 않습니다.
\n
\n\t• 서비스는 \"있는 그대로\" 제공됩니다. Igalia와 컨트리뷰터, 라이센서 및 배포자는 명시적 또는 묵시적 여부에 관계없이 서비스에 대한 모든 보증을 (서비스가 판매가능하며, 귀하에 특정목적에 부합하다는 보증을 포함) 부인합니다. 귀하는 귀하의 목적에 의한 서비스 이용 및 서비스 품질 및 성능에서 기인하는 모든 위험을 부담합니다.
\n
\n\t• 관련 법률에 의한 경우를 제외하고, Igalia와 컨트리뷰터, 라이센서 및 배포자는 Wolvic 및 서비스 사용으로 인해 발생하는 직접, 간접, 부수적, 특별, 결과적 또는 징벌적 손해에 대해 책임을 지지 않는다. 이 약관으로 인해 발생하는 연대 책임은 미화 500달러를 넘을 수 없습니다. 일부 관활에서는 특정한 종류의 손해를 제외하거나 제한하는 것을 허용하지 않으므로, 이러한 제외 및 제한은 사용자에게 적용되지 않을 수 있습니다.
\n
\n\t• Igalia는 필요에 따라 본 약관을 수시로 변경할 수 있습니다. 본 약관들은 Igalia의 서면 동의 없이 수정 혹은 삭제될 수 없습니다.
\n
\n\t• 본 약관들은, 법률 조항의 충돌이 발생한 경우를 제외하고, 스페인 법률에 준거한다. 본 약관의 일부 조항이 무효하거나 시행할 수 없다고 판명된 경우, 본 약관의 나머지 조항의 유효성에는 영향을 미치지 않으며 완전한 효력을 유지합니다. 약관의 번역본과 원본(스페인어) 사이에 충돌이 있을 경우, 원본(스페인어)이 우선 적용됩니다.
\n
\n\t• 귀하가 하나 혹은 복수의 서비스들을 사용하지 않거나 위 약관에 동의하지 않는 경우, 해당 기능 또는 서비스(들)을 비활성화할 수 있습니다. 특정 기능 또는 서비스를 비활성화하는 방법은 아래에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 다른 기능과 서비스는 애플리케이션 설정에서 비활성화할 수 있습니다.
\n
\n\t\t◦ 세이프 브라우징 기능은 기본적으로 활성화되어 있습니다. 안전하지 않은 사이트에 방문하는 것을 방지하기 위해, 이 기능을 비활성화 하는 것은 권장하지 않습니다. 이 기능을 완전히 비활성화 하는 방법은 다음과 같습니다:
\n
\n\t\t\t⁃ URL바에 about:config를 입력합니다.
\n
\n\t\t\t- browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled를 입력합니다.
\n
\n\t\t\t- browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled 항목을 더블클릭합니다.
\n
\n\t\t\t- browser.safebrowsing.phishing.enabled를 입력합니다.
\n
\n\t\t\t- browser.safebrowsing.phishing.enabled 항목을 더블클릭합니다.
\n
\n\t\t\t- 이제 세이프 브라우징이 비활성화됐습니다.
\n
\n\t\t◦ 위치 인식(Location Aware Browsing) 기능은 항상 사용자의 사전 동의가 필요합니다. 귀하의 사전 동의 없이는 어떠한 위치 정보도 전송되지 않습니다. 이 기능을 완전히 비활성화 하는 방법은 다음과 같습니다:
\n
\n\t\t\t⁃ URL바에 about:config를 입력합니다.
\n
\n\t\t\t- geo.enabled를 입력합니다.
\n
\n\t\t\t- geo.enabled 설정을 더블클릭합니다.
\n
\n\t\t\t- 이제 위치 인식이 비활성화됐습니다.
\n
\n\t\t◦ Wolvic의 향상된 추적 방지(Enhanced Tracking Protection) 기능은 귀하가 브라우징하는 동안 자동으로 개인 정보를 보호합니다. 이 기능은 귀하의 브라우징 습관과 관심사에 관한 정보를 수집하기 위해 온라인 상에서 발생하는 추적을 사이트의 기능 손상 없이 차단합니다. 또한, 이 기능은 배터리를 소모하는 멀웨어(malware)와 같은 해로운 스크립트도 차단합니다. 추적 방지 기능에는 세 가지 모드가 있습니다: 표준(Standard), 엄격(Strict), 해제(Off). 이 기능을 해제하는 방법은 다음과 같습니다.
\n
\n\t\t\t⁃ \"개인정보 보호 &amp; 보안(Privacy &amp; Security)” 설정으로 이동합니다.
\n
\n\t\t\t⁃ \"해제\" 라디오 버튼을 선택합니다.
\n
\n\t\t\t⁃ 이제 향상된 추적 방지가 해제됐습니다.</string>

\nIGALIA는 사용자를 식별할 수 있는 방식으로 개인 데이터를 수집하지 않습니다. 그러므로 직간접적으로 IGALIA에 신원을 공개하거나 개인 데이터를 제공하지 않고도 이 응용 프로그램을 사용하고 가상 현실 환경을 참조하고 탐색할 수 있습니다. 따라서 IGALIA는 WOLVIC에 입력된 어떤 데이터에 관해서도 법률상의 책임을 지지 않습니다.
\nIGALIA가 이 응용 프로그램의 사용을 위해 획득하는 유일한 데이터 및 정보는 사용자에게 개별적으로 연결되지 않으며 다음과 같습니다.
\n
\n\t• 분석적이고 순수하게 통계적이며 비식별적 데이터
\n\t• 음성을 캡쳐하여 텍스트로 변환하기 위해 사용자의 사운드 데이터는 이러한 목적을 위해 만들어진 API를 통해서 각 플랫폼을 담당하는 제 3자 회사가 소유한 서버로 전송됩니다: 예를 들어, Facebook의 Oculus 서비스는 Oculus Voice SDK로 전송합니다. 앞서 언급한 데이터는 그 어떤 시점에서도 IGALIA 소유의 서버에서 처리, 접근, 통합되지 않습니다. 전송된 데이터는 각 플랫폼을 소유한 제 3자 회사들(이하 제 3자들)이 전적으로 책임질 것이며, 이는 유럽 연합 외부에 위치할 수 있고 사용자 프라이버시를 덜 보호하는 법적 제도를 적용할 수도 있습니다. 서비스를 수락하고 사용하기 전에 이러한 외부 플랫폼들의 개인 정보 정책 및 사용 약관을 주의 깊게 읽어볼 것을 권장합니다. IGALIA는 상기 제 3자들의 개인 데이터 처리에 관해 직간접적으로 책임을 지지 않습니다.
\n\t• 지리적 위치 정보는 시스템에서 사용되는 것이 아니라 브라우저에서 얻을 수 있습니다. 그러나 그렇게 하기 위해선, 이와 관련한 특정 통지를 통해서 장치의 위치 권한을 설정해야 하며, IGALIA는 앞서 언급한 정보를 식별 되었거나 식별 가능한 사람으로 연결 지을 수 없습니다. 만약 그것이 적용 가능하다면, 이전 항목에서 언급한 제 3자들은 그렇게 할 수도 있습니다. 제 3자들의 법적 조항에 주의를 기울이는 것을 권장합니다.
\n\t• IGALIA는 귀하가 방문한 주소 또는 URL에 어떠한 방식으로도 접근하거나 저장하지 않습니다.
\n\t• 브라우저 탐색 기록 또는 사용자 북마크와 같은 데이터를 동기화 하기 위해서 (Mozilla 계정 또는 Google 계정과 같은) 클라우드 서비스와 통합될 수 있습니다. 이러한 경우, IGALIA는 어떤 방식으로든 어떠한 정보에도 접근하거나 처리하지 않으며 IGALIA의 서버로도 전달하지 않습니다.
\n
\n귀하가 이 애플리케이션과 함께 접근하거나 사용하는 제 3자 플랫폼들이 자발적 또는 비자발적 및/또는 의식적 또는 무의식적으로 유럽 데이터 보호법의 범위를 벗어나 귀하에 관한 식별 데이터를 수집할 수 있음을 다시 한번 알려드립니다. 따라서 다음과 같은 제3자의 법적 조항들을 숙지하고 특별한 주의를 기울이는 것을 권장합니다.

IGALIA는 녹음을 특정 사용자와 연결하거나 개인 정보에 영향을 미치는데 어떠한 관심도 없습니다. 결과적으로 IGALIA는 어떤 종류의 개인 정보나 기밀 정보도 사운드 음성 주소에 포함되지 않도록 합니다.
\n어떤 경우에도 IGALIA는 이해 당사자에게 개인 데이터에 관한 접근, 수정, 삭제, 변환, 처리 제한 및 이동 권리의 행사를 보장합니다.

\n위의 두 경우 모두 이해 당사자는 신분증, 여권 또는 신분 증명서의 사본을 첨부해야 합니다.
\n데이터 보호 책임자 또는 권리 관리를 위임받은 부서는 이용 목적에 적합한 형식으로 권리 행사를 기록할 것이며 다음과 같은 데이터들이 기록 됩니다.
