\n
\n\t•Igaliaとその貢献者、ライセンサー、またはパートナーは可能な限り正確かつ最新のサービスを提供することを心がけています。ですがその情報が完全かつエラーの無いものだと保証はできません。例としてSafe Browsing Serviceは全ての危ないサイトを特定できないまたは安全なサイトを誤って特定する可能性があります。またLocation Aware Serviceではサービス提供者が申告する全ての位置は推計であり、当社やサービス提供者はその位置の正確性の保証はできません。
\n
\n\t• Igaliaは任意にサービスを廃止または変更する場合があります。
\n
\n\t• お客様は付属のWolvicバーションでサービスを自由に利用できます、そしてIgaliaもその権利を付与します。サービスに関する他の権利はIgaliaとそのライセンサーが全て保護しています。当規約はWolvicや該当するソースコード版のWolvicに該当するオープンソースライセンスの権利を制限するものではありません。
\n
\n\t• サービスは「あるがまま」で提供しています。Igaliaとその貢献者、ライセンサー、配布者はいかなる種類（明示的や暗示的を問わず、そして制限無くサービスの商品性またはお客様の用途に適切かの保証も含め）の保証も無く提供します。サービスを用途に適するための選択またはサービスのクオリティや性能の全てのリスクはお客様に帰属します。
\n
\n\t•法に義務付けられない限りIgaliaとその貢献者、ライセンサー、配布者はWolvicやサービスの利用に基づいたまたは関連する一切の傷害賠償責任（間接的、特殊的、偶然的、必然的、懲罰的、模範的な損害を含む）を有する事は無い。この規約による連帯責任の賠償は５００ドルを超える事は無い。特定の法的管轄では特定の損害の除外や制限を認めていないので上記の除外や制限が適用されない場合もあります。
\n
\n\t• Igaliaは必要があれば当規約を更新する可能性があります。Igaliaの書面による同意がない場合この規約の更新や解除は不可能です。
\n
\n\t• 当規約は、抵触法の規定を除き、スペイン国法に準拠しています。もし規約の一部が無効または法的強制力がないと判断された場合、本規約の他の規定は引き続き完全な効力と効果を維持するものとします。もし本規約の翻訳版とスペイン語の原語が抵触する場合スペイン語版が統制するものとします。
\n
\n\t• サービスの一部を利用したくない場合や上記の規約に不同意の場合は機能やサービスを不有効にできます。各機能やサービスを不有効にする手順は下記の通りです。他の機能やサービスはアプリケーションの設定で不有効にできます。
\n
\n\t\t◦ Safe browsingは通常は有効にされています。Safe Browsingの機能を不有効に設定するのは危ないサイトに移動する可能性があり非推奨です。完全に機能を停止する場合は下記の通りに設定してください：
\n
\n\t\t\t⁃ URLバーでabout:configと入力する
\n
\n\t\t\t⁃ browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabledを入力する

\n\t\t◦ WolvicのEnhanced Tracking Protectionはブラウズする際に自動的にプライバシーを保護します。サイトの機能を妨害しないで個人情報やブラウジングの習慣を集めるためにネットで追跡するトラッカーを制限するものです。危ないスクリプト、例えばバッテリーを消費するマルウェアーなど、を制限する機能もあります。トラッキング保護のモードは三つあります： Standard、Strict と Off。もし不有効にする場合は下記の通りに設定してください：
\n
\n\t\t\t⁃ 「プライバシーとセキュリティー」の設定に移動。
\n
\n\t\t\t⁃ 「Off」を選択。
